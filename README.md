## These are my personal config files for lunarvim
**Make sure to install lunarvim before cloning this otherwise it will NOT work**

These are my personal configurations for lunarvim (and some notes in case clipboard stops working).

**Credits to (lunarvim)[https://www.lunarvim.org/] for making an exellent configuration that I very much like as well as 
nvchad for also making a very nice (and easier to understand) config that has inspired many keybinds / keymaps in this config
too.**
